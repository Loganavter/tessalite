### **Project Overview: Tessalite**

**1. Executive Summary**

Tessalite is a planned node-based interface, conceptually similar to existing applications like Chainner and ComfyUI. However, it is uniquely targeted at media content creators and digital archivists. The core objective is to provide a user-friendly, visual environment for constructing complex processing pipelines, simplifying tasks that would otherwise require intricate scripting and data parsing.

**2. Core Concept & Unique Value Proposition**

The primary innovation of Tessalite lies in its architecture, designed to function as a universal "assembler." It will enable users to build complex, nested media projects (metaphorically, "Matryoshka dolls") from a wide array of disparate source files. This approach is intended to streamline and automate workflows, saving users a significant amount of manual processing time.

**3. Technology Stack**

*   **Backend Engine:** FFmpeg will be utilized for robust media processing and manipulation.
*   **Frontend Framework:** The graphical user interface (GUI) is being developed using PyQt6.
*   **Architectural Pattern:** The project aims to adhere to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

**4. Current Development Status & Challenges**

As of this writing, the project is in a very early, pre-alpha stage ("post-gamma"), approximately two weeks into development.

Key challenges include:
*   **Design Complexity:** The inherent complexity of designing a flexible and powerful node-based system.
*   **Developer Experience:** The lead developer, while experienced in traditional desktop GUI development, finds the paradigm shift to node-based editor design to be a significant challenge.
*   **Project Iteration:** The project has already undergone a full rewrite of its frontend and backend components in an effort to find a more optimal architecture.

**5. Project Philosophy & Motivation**

The decision to develop a new application from the ground up, rather than creating modules for an existing platform like Chainner, is driven by a fundamental disagreement with the principles of the GPL software license. The goal is to create a unique architecture without the constraints imposed by such licenses.

**6. Project Roadmap & Timeline**

Development progress is currently constrained by the developer's limited time due to commitments to other hobbies and projects.

*   **Tentative Release Date:** A provisional release is projected for mid-2026.
*   **Contingency:** This timeline is subject to change and is contingent upon the developer's sustained interest and ability to dedicate time to the project.
